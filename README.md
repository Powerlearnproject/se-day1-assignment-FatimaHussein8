Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering priciples, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power  various aspects of modern life including communication.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages eg Fortran
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design - creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation - writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing - conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment - releasing the software to users or customers
6. Maintenance - Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases, flowing downwards like a waterfall while on the other hand  Agile is a iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer - is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures software quality by designing and executing test 
plans.
3. Project Manager - oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is a Software suites that provide 
comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code eg Visual Studio.
Version Control Systems (VCS) is a Software tools used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements
2. Tight deadlines
3. Technical debt
 strategies.
1. Effective communication
2. Prioritization of tasks
3. Agile methodologies
   
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing - is for testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing - is for testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing - is for testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing - is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance
1. quality control measures such as code reviews
2. Automated testing

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt
"Tell me about starting a business."
Improved Prompt
"What are the first three steps to start a small business with low capital?"
The improved prompt is clear, and specific. It asks for a step-by-step approach, specifies the type of business (small), and sets a constraint (low capital), making it easier to provide a useful and targeted response.
